# OER on Geospatial Web Services (Work in Progress!)          

This repository contains all the materials used to create and publish an Open Educational Resource (OER) on Geospatial Web Services. The OER module provides a) some background information on Geospatial Web Services and b) technical guidance on how to use Geospatial Web Services within an Open Source Gis (QGIS), as well as an Open Source Server (GeoServer). 

### Content:
The module is structured as follows

1. Overview
2. Thematic Background 
3. Excercices and Guides
4. Quiz
5. Wrap up 

This tutorial is mainly designed for students who want to spend about ... minutes on improving their skills in integrating Data from Geosaptial Web Services. You should have some basic knowledge of GIS Software and it wouldn't be bad if you already have some experience in using the free open source Software Geoserver.

### How to use the OER Module

The OER is implemented as an  [H5P](https://h5p.org/) module that can be downloaded and embedded into any H5P runtime environment, such as: 
- Learning management systems based on Moodle or Ilias 
- H5P editing environments such as the [H5P Official Editor](https://h5p.org/) or the lightweight [LUMI H5P editor](https://lumi.education/)
- Content managament systems such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) with "H5P" plugin installed

Simply download just the H5P file, upload it to one of the environments and use it from there...

###Quick Overview of the Content

If you first want to get a quick overview of the concrete contents of the H5P module, you will find a script structured according to the H5P module with integrated illustrations in the [Storyboard](/StoryBoard_Deutsch.md).
